# YouTube Search Engine
This is the **YouTube Search Engine** repository that contains a complete YouTube video search script.
Search box is animated on blur and focus with jQuery.

So when you click on the search box, it will expand, animate and enlarge, and when you click outside the search box, it will shrink again.

In this project, it's built a search engine using YouToube data API v3. When typing something into the search bar it's gonna search YouTube videos that match the search phrase and then display them nicely on the website. With a click on the title of the video, it will open up in the application, without redirecting to YouTube.

It will show up as a result of five videos without showing ads, and when scroll down it will appear options for going to the next page. If we go to the next it will also appear the button for the back to the previous page.

This project is done with semantic HTML5 markup, CSS styling, YouTube Data API v3, jQuery channelList() and searchList() methods, FancyBox JavaScript plugin to open videos and JavaScript functions for previous and next paging.
